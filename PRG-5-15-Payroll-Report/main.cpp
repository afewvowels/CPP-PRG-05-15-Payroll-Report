//  Write a program that displays a weekly payroll report. A loop in the program should
//  ask the user for the employee number, gross pay, state tax, federal tax, and FICA withholdings.
//  The loop will terminate when 0 is entered for the employee number. After the
//  data is entered, the program should display totals for gross pay, state tax, federal tax,
//  FICA withholdings, and net pay.
//
//  Input Validation: Do not accept negative numbers for any of the items entered. Do
//  not accept values for state, federal, or FICA withholdings that are greater than the
//  gross pay. If they sum of state tax + federal tax + FICA withholdings for any employee
//  is greater than gross pay, print an error message and ask the user to reenter the data
//  for that employee.
